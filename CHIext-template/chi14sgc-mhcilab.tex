\begin{abstract}
Speech ability, a general habit becoming nature for us, plays an important role in our daily life, but if one day we can't speak anymore, using body language becomes a evident feasible way to communicate between human beings.
Mute Robot Game has been designed to provide players a new environment where they become a robot without speech ability. The game intend to supply players facing in challenging stages. 
Players communicate with body language, with an emphasis on cooperation to facilitate immersion with each other.
%Players need to cooperate with each other to pass challenges by using body language communication.

% =============================================================================
Mute Robot shows a new integration between current gameplay style and body language, where the interaction between game and human body movement form a unprecedented innovative gameplay empiriment.
Our statistics results indicate that Mute Robot can proliferation of communication and interaction between players.
The Kinect-based manipulation can facilitate the body language interation and intrinsically motivate the player.
Mute Robot provide a path towards future exploration of this relatively unexplored field of game design with capacious development space.
